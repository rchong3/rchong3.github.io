<p>Mari Kimura is an innovative violinist and composer who is well-known for her research in computer-augmented music.</p>
<p> On the violin, Kimura is both a virtuosic performer and improviser. Additionally, her experimentation with violin technique led to her introducing the world to subharmonics, a technique that extends the violin's range up to a full octave below the lowest note it can naturally play. Kimura has incorporated subharmonics into her own compositions including <em>6 Caprices for Subharmonics</em> (1997-1998), <em>Gemini</em> for solo violin (1993), and her cadenza for Jean-Claude Risset's Violin Concerto <em>Sch√©mes</em> (2006-2007). Since 2017, Kimura has been a Professor of Music at UC Irvine's ICIT (Integrated Composition, Improvisation, and Technology) program in the Claire Trevor School of the Arts Music Department. In September 2020, she released a her motion sensor, MUGIC, commercially, making it more accessible for musicians to interact with and control technology during performances.</p>

<h3>Mastering the Violin</h3>
<p>Mari Kimura was born and raised in Tokyo, Japan. She earned a Bachelor of Music from the Toho School of Music studying violin performance under Toshia Eto. On Eto's recommendation, Kimura would go to Boston University to pursue a Master in Music for violin performance under Roman Totenberg, a friend of her former professor.</p>
