<p>Mari Kimura is an innovative violinist and composer who is well-known for her research in computer-augmented music. On the violin, Kimura is a virtuosic performer, improviser, and innovator. As a composer, she incorporates her work on the cutting edge of music technology and violin playing in her music. Since 2017, Kimura has been a Professor of Music at UC Irvine's ICIT (Integrated Composition, Improvisation, and Technology) program in the Claire Trevor School of the Arts Music Department. In September 2020, she released a her motion sensor, MUGIC, commercially, making it more accessible for musicians to interact with and control technology during performances.</p>

<h3>Mastering the Violin</h3>
<p>Mari Kimura was born and raised in Tokyo, Japan. As a teenager, she studied under the violinist Armand Weisbord. Kimura earned a Bachelor of Music from the Toho Gakuen School of Music studying violin performance with Toshia Eto. On Eto's recommendation, Kimura would go to Boston University to pursue a Master in Music with Roman Totenberg, a friend of her former professor. While studying at Boston University, Kimura would have a master class Joseph Fuchs who invited her to study with him at Julliard.</p>
<p>Her first teacher Weisbord introduced her to many unconventional techniques designed to enhance her violin playing. One of these exercises was a modified version of "Son Filé", where a violinist draws the bow slowly while also applying more pressure. When pursuing her Doctor of Music at Julliard, Kimura noticed faint notes below the note being played while practicing Ravel's Tzigane. This observation led to a moment of inspiration and after two weeks of diligent practice, Kimura developed a clearer understanding of the pressure, placement, and speed of the bow required to produce subharmonics.</p>
<p>Kimura introduced the world to subharmonics through her first composition, ALT. Kimura has since incorporated subharmonics into various other compositions including <em>Gemini</em> for solo violin (1993), "<em>6 Caprices for Subharmonics</em>" (1997-1998), and her cadenza for Jean-Claude Risset's Violin Concerto <em>Schémes</em> (2006-2007).</p>
